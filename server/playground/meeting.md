What's the main focus (priority):

1- Calling Stability - I have a idea about how to make Calling Stable i.e
before connecting the call we will run a test suite will test  
microphone,network,throughput,connectivity.

Idea second:
1- We can directly pass TURN/STUN server url and test network diagnosis in our tool
2- UI side error is handled

1- Calling Stability
2- Security & compliance is ensured
3- Very seamless experience from UI.

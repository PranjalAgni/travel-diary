Accounts Receivable refers to the outstanding invoices a company has or the money the company is owed from its clients. The phrase refers to accounts a business has a right to receive because it has delivered a product or service. Receivables essentially represent a line of credit extended by a company and due within a relatively short time period, ranging from a few days to a year.

Breaking Down 'Accounts Receivable - AR'
On a public company's balance sheet, accounts receivable is often recorded as an asset, because there is a legal obligation for the customer to remit cash for the debt. If a company has receivables, this means it has made a sale but has yet to collect the money from the purchaser.

The accounts receivable process includes five key operations:-
[x] Credit Management
Credit management is the process of granting credit, the terms it's granted on and recovering this credit when it's due. The Credit Management function incorporates all of a company’s activities aimed at ensuring that customers pay their invoices within the defined payment terms and conditions

[x] Cash Application
Cash application is a part of the accounts receivable process that applies incoming payments to the correct customer accounts and receivable invoices. In order to do this, the first step is to determine where to apply for the payments. This is normally done by matching the payment to the associated invoices.
[x] Electronic Invoice Presentment and Payment (Invoicing)
An invoice is a commercial document that itemizes a transaction between a buyer and a seller. If goods or services were purchased on credit, the invoice usually specifies the terms of the deal, and provide information on the available methods of payment. An invoice is also known as a bill or sales invoice.

[x] Collections Management
One of the main components of generating cash flow is clients paying their bills. Sales and accounts receivable collection procedures do not wait until the payment is late. The process of collecting on a sales invoice begins when the invoice is generated and ends when the payment is received.
[x] Deductions Management
When you receive payment from customers, a customer might reduce the amount of a payment for unknown reasons, or for reasons that might be associated with a specific invoice or a group of invoices, such as damaged goods.
